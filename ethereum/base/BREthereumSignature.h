/**
 * An Ethereum Signature Type is an enumeration for the types of ethereum signatures.  There
 * are two types: one for signing transactions and one for signing P2P messages, it seems.  An
 * ethereum signature is 'recoverable' in that given the signature and the data one can recover
 * the public key (corresponding to the private key used for signing) and then from the public key
 * one can recover the address.
 *
 * The names 'VRS_EIP' and 'RSV' are arbitrary - originally they had to do with where in the
 * signature, produced by BRKeyCompactSign, the 'v' was encoded - first (byte 0) or last (byte 65).
